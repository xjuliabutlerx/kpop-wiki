# A Basic K-Pop Wiki using Reactive Programming
I completed this basic wiki using Springboot and Cassandra that runs on a local Docker container. The basic functionality of adding, updating, viewing, deleting, and clearing the Wiki are all based on the Swagger UI.

I followed the tutorial outlined in <a href="https://github.com/ignatius525/reactiveApiDemo">Ignat's repository</a> for CSCI 435.
